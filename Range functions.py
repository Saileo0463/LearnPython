"We are going to see the range func"
"In Range func we have to give the list while printing the statement\
otherswise it wont print properly"

#eg:1
print(list(range(10)))
print(list(range(1,10)))
print(list(range(1,10,2))) #1 will be a starting point, 10 will be a ending point and 2 will be a increment of 2"

#eg:2
"Print only even numbers between 1-10"
print(list(range(2,10,2)))

#eg:3
"Print only odd numbers between 1-10"
print(list(range(1,10,2)))

#eg:4
"With negative values"
print(list(range(10,1,-1)))
